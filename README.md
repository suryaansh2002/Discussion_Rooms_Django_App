## Discussion Rooms Django App

This is the first web application I made using django.

### It is a website consisting of discussion rooms on a variety of topics where a user can login, create new rooms and participate in discussions in existing rooms. 

Users can conveniently filter rooms from the search bar or the topic buttons on the left side, and can view a summary of all the recent activity on the right side.

### If none of the existing rooms are of an interest to the user, they can create a new room, and begin discussions there.

### Once inside a room, users can participate in discussions, and can also delete messages or rooms created by them earlier. They can also view all the users participating in discussion in a particular room, on the right side.

### Lastly users can view their own, and other users' profiles. And update their profiles with ease.
